Implementing HTTP Basic Authentication in a Spring Boot REST API

Spring Boot REST APIs have different types of clients accessing from different locations. At times, these APIs need to perform tasks to generate and share sensitive data. Now all clients should not get access to such data, but only a privileged set of clients should. In such scenarios, you need to secure your REST API.

One approached to secure REST API is using HTTP basic authentication.

In this post, I will demonstrate how to restrict access to sensitive data using HTTP basic authentication.
